# AssignmentSubmissionSystem
This assignment submission system is a web portal, built as a part of the course ISTM 630 (MIS Project Management and Implementation) at Texas A&amp;M University. This portal allows for file uploads by students to a central repository uniquely segregated into separate assignments. These assignments will subsequently be reflected on the website, for others (peers, Professor, TA) to download, view and critique. 
The website can be viewed here: http://fall2018602group12.com
