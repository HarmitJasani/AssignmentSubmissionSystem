# AssignmentSubmissionSystem
This assignment submission system is a web portal, built to house important assignments and documents undertaken for the course - ISTM 630 (MIS Project Management and Implementation) at Texas A&amp;M University. This portal allows for file uploads by students to a central repository uniquely segregated into separate assignments.These assignments will subsequently be reflected on the website, for others (peers, Professor, TA) to download, view and critique. The sole purpose of such a centralized online repository is to facilitate convenience and ease of access. 
The website can be viewed here: http://fall2018602group12.com \n 
Its administrator panel can be viewed here: http://fall2018602group12.com/admin.php
